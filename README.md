# GwentRank and Pro Player Estimates

Data for on players in Pro Ladder is released on [playgwent.com](https://masters.playgwent.com/en/), but it is limited.
You get the rank, the score, the country of origin and the number of matches played. Using some fairly basic data
analysis tricks there must be more we can do with these data! Using python we'll scrape data for the top 
[Gwent players on pro-ladder](https://masters.playgwent.com/en/rankings/masters-2/season-of-the-draconid/1/1) 
and calculate additional statistics about the current season, popularity of the game in different countries, players' 
efficiency, players national rank, ...

Furthermore there is a notebook to estimate how many Pro Players there actually are as there are only 2860 reported on the Gwent Masters Website.

Both notebooks can be launched directly into Binder so you can play with the code without installing anything.
